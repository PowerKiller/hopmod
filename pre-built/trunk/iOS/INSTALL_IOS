INSTALLATION:

Get openssh-server and coreutils from cydia so you are able to
ssh onto your device.

Make sure to change the default password (which is alpine) for both,
mobile AND root (install the server as mobile user).

Once you have done this, install subversion from cydia.

Then do a checkout of this repository.
svn co https://hopmod.googlecode.com/svn/pre-built/trunk/iOS/

Now you can run the server as usually:
bin/server

That's it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multi-arch binary, contains both armv6 and armv7, so should work on
every iOS version starting from 4.0 (maybe works on 3.x too, - not tested).

Hopmod Revision: see rev.h
Compiler: clang version 3.4 (181587)

You can get pre-compiled libraries, which are required for compiling
hopmod for iOS from here:
