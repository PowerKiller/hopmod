SUPPORTED DEVICES:
All devices with one of these cpu types: 
 armv6, armv7 or armv7s with iOS 4+

INSTALLATION:

Get openssh-server and coreutils from cydia so you are able to
ssh onto your device.

Make sure to change the default password (which is alpine) for both,
mobile AND root (install the server as mobile user).

Once you have done this, install subversion from cydia.

Then do a checkout of this repository.
svn co https://hopmod.googlecode.com/svn/pre-built/trunk/iOS/

Now you can run the server as usually:
bin/server

That's it.
