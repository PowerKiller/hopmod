Server-side player commands supported by the server.

= Introduction =

== Table of Common Parameters ==

|| *ID* || *Description* ||
|| `<cn>` || A client number, every player connected to the server is uniquely assigned one of these numbers. Most player specific commands require a CN argument to address a player, the list of client numbers is visible from the scoreboard window to master and admin players. ||

|| `#stats` || Display your statistics (frags, deaths, accuracy etc.) for the current game. This command is useful because it displays variables not shown in the scoreboard window.||
|| `#stats total` || Display your cumulative statistics for all the games you've played on the server. Player records are identified by player name alone, for an unmixed record be sure to choose a distinctive player name.
