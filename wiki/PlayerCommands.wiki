Server-side player commands supported by the server.

= Introduction =

== Table of Common Parameters ==

|| *ID* || *Description* ||
|| `<cn>` || A client number, every player connected to the server is uniquely assigned one of these numbers. Most player specific commands require a CN argument to address a player, the list of client numbers is visible from the scoreboard window to master and admin players. ||

= Public Commands =

|| *Command Line* || *Description* ||
|| `#stats` || Display your statistics (frags, deaths, accuracy etc.) for the current game. This command is useful because it displays variables not shown in the scoreboard window.||
|| `#stats total` || Display your cumulative statistics for all the games you've played on the server. Player records are identified by player name alone, for an unmixed record be sure to choose a distinctive player name. Player names cannot be reserved (we're missing an authentication system) and it's entirely possible that your record could be tainted by another player.||
|| `#teamkills` || Display your team kill statistics and information on the server's team kill limit configuration. ||
|| `#nextmap` || Tells you what the next map will be. The usefulness of the command depends on the server configuration, it only works when the server is configured to use a static server-side map rotation. ||
|| `#msg <cn> <msg>` || Send a private chat message to another player in the game.||

= Privileged Commands =

|| *Command Line* || *Description* ||
|| `#givemaster <cn>` || Hand over master privilege to another player. ||
|| `#names <cn>` || List previously used names of a player. Players are identified by IP address.||
