== Introduction ==

Everything from event handlers to variables and functions originate in <tt>conf/server.conf</tt> file, the first three scripts include all the extras server functions developed by the Hopmod project. 

<code>
exec "scripts/baselib.csl"
exec "conf/vars.conf"
exec "scripts/servermod.cs"

//# Put your code here.
</code>

== Quick tips ==

=== Setup a server shell (new experimental functionality) ===

Add the following line to your conf/server.conf file:
<code>script_socket_server 7894</code>

Restart your server or execute the reloadconfig function for the changes to take affect. The <tt>script_socket_server</tt> function starts a light http server on a given port, accepting POST requests to "/serverexec", clients send cubescript code and the /serverexec resource responds with the code's evaluation result. The server only accepts connections from localhost.

Run the bin/shell.rb script.
<code>$ bin/shell.rb</code>

If connection is successful you should see the shell prompt.
<code>server> </code>

=== Message from Console ===

<code>console "youradminname" "Server will be shutting down at the end of this game!"</code>

=== Timed banner message ===

<code>interval (mins 5) [msg "Some annoying message"]</code>

=== Generate scoreboard web page ===
<code>exec scripts/stats/scoreboardgen.cs</code>
